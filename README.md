# slotBot

A command-line controller program for a robotic arm that takes commands that move blocks stacked in a series of slots.

The program is written in Python 2.7 and can be run with:

###python slotbot.py

After initializing the slots with an integer, you'll be able to type "help" for a list of commands.

## If I had more time I would:
    * Implement printing methods
    * Add error printing methods to make it more obvious when a user has input a bad command 
    * Handle software failure by catching excpetions
    * Create tests for each class method
    * Run through pyLint and fix PEP-8 violations
